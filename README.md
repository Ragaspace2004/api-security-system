# 🧠 Context-Aware API Security System

A powerful tool that sees **how your APIs are being used** — and spots security risks based on real usage patterns.

### 🔍 What It Does

This system watches how users interact with your APIs over time. Then, it highlights unusual behavior, risky flows, or missing checks that attackers might exploit.

### 🔐 Why It’s Different

Unlike traditional scanners, this tool understands the *context* — who is doing what, and when — to find problems that static tools often miss.

### 🌐 Key Features

- Visualizes user flows across APIs
- Detects business logic abuse & broken access
- Smart detection of suspicious behavior
- Easy-to-read reports and attack flow maps

### 📁 How To Use

1. Upload your API file or logs  
2. Let the system analyze and map usage  
3. Review the insights and fix issues
